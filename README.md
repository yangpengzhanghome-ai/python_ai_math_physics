# Python AI & Math Learning Journey

This repository documents my daily practice and projects as I learn Python, mathematics, and AI algorithms over the next six months.

## Goals
- Master core Python syntax and data science libraries (NumPy, Pandas).
- Understand the fundamental math behind machine learning.
- Build machine learning and deep learning projects from scratch.

## Current Progress
- **Week 1**: Python basics (variables, loops, functions). See the `Exercises/` folder.

## How to Run
Simply clone the repository 
`git clone https://github.com/yangpengzhanghome-ai/python_ai_math_physics.git` and run any Python file:
`python hello.py`
